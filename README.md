# Adressverwaltung project @ gibsso
> This is an import of my personal space of projects done at gibsso (school) from my gitlab space

Given the educational task to learn java, mvc, in code documentation and agile work, the project "adressverwaltung" (german for contact registry) was chosen to demonstrate this.

Tools used:
- `Maven`: Used to manage and build dependencies
- `Eclipse`: The IDE which was used to code
